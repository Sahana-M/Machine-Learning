# Genetic algorithms #

Genetic algorithms are one of the best methods to find out which algorithm suits our data. It follows three methods
1. Selection
2. Cross over
3. Mutation

By iterating through a number of generations and crossing over the fittest models in each generation and doing a mutation on them will finally result in the best fitted model for our problem
This is an optimization problem
